DONE:
- Better memory manage (smart pointers, vector instead of list)
- Extract all random number generations to a class so that seeding and initialising is done just once
- Add image.h
- Rework to add scenes and renderer
- Switch to use uint8_t, uin16_t, etc
- Add motion blur
- Add timing tool:
    - class plemma::chronometer::SingleMeasurement
    - free method plemma::crhonometer::MeasureFunction()

TODOs:
- Add Bounding Volume Hierarchies
- Try to switch to constexpr as much as possible
- Use timing tool to find out if constexpr is helping
- Add the option to check if the new Hitable would invade other Hitables in HitableList::Add()
- Improve code quality:
    * Improve use of namespaces
    * Check that naming conventions are preserved (as of Google's style guide or whichever is decided)
    * Add automatic formatting
- Add Catch2 as testing library
- Create tests
Property-based testing seems a good approach, Catch2 still doesn't support fully
property-based testing, but generators might provide a good start:
