DONE:
- Better memory manage (smart pointers, vector instead of list)
- Extract all random number generations to a class so that seeding and initialising is done just once

TODOs:
- Add image.h
- Rework to add scenes and renderer
- Switch to use uint8_t, etc
- Add timing tool:
chronometer::start();
chronometer::end("Process X", units); // that should produce "Process X tool *end - start in $units * $units".
chronometer::measure(MyMethod(arg1, arg2, argn), "MyMethod", units); // that should make the call MyMethod(arg1, arg2, argn) and write "MyMethod took ..."
- Improve structure and create a "renderer" class or something similar.
- Add methods in HitableList that handle the addition of Hitables,
with the option to check if the new Hitable would invade other Hitables.
- Improve code quality:
    * Add namespaces
    * Check that naming conventions are preserved (as of Google's style guide)
    * Add automatic formatting
- Exchange gtest by Catch2 as testing library
- Create tests
- Add scenes folder where each scene will have its own file
